title: What is Holistic Coaching?
definition: "Holistic relates to Holism. It is the theory that parts of a whole are in intimate interconnection, such that they cannot exist independently of the whole, or cannot be understood without reference to the whole, which is thus regarded as greater than the sum of its parts."

My Holistic approach aims to look at every dimension of the business to help find a balance towards optimal performance.

A company's performance is a perfect reflection of the alignment of its management methods and its personnel. A company whose management team is not healthy, both in terms of teamwork, business practices and the health of its individuals will be impacted by these weaknesses. Research are abundant in demonstrating the benefit of employee well-being at work.

In all my assignment, I combine my 25 years of business experience and my 12 years in the holistic health field to help you meet your objectives.
