Entrepreneur and highly effective team leader with 25+ years of experience in Organizational Transformation, Project, Program and Portfolio Management, Business Process Improvement (BPI) and Management (BPM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and other System Implementation, across industries. Dynamic, visionary, thought leader with proven ability to deal with complex situations, build high performance team, drive execution and deliver lasting results.

Born in Quebec, with a Bachelor in Business Administration of [l’Université de Sherbrooke](https://www.usherbrooke.ca/) and an MBA of [Keller Graduate School](https://www.keller.edu/) of Management, I leaved 12 years in the United States and worked across multiple industries for small, medium and large enterprises.

Back in Quebec in 2013, I changed direction to focus on health. After several years in the corporate environment I developed a good understanding of stress, stress management and the damage stress can cause if not addressed properly. From energy drain, difficulty to sleep, skin reaction, and all kind of health issues if people do not have tools or means to deal with stress.To find out more about my [health recovery journey](https://coaching.nancybilodeau.com/en/about) you can read my Bio under the [Individual Services ](https://coaching.nancybilodeau.com/en/)section of this site.

After founding, managing and selling my own business, I returned to the corporate world, this time, integrating my learning of global health, nutrition, heart coherence, yoga and meditation into my work. Passionate about business results and the well being of people at work, I plan to bring a unique service offering, a holistic approach, in finding the rightbalance towards optimal business performance.My approach combines my 25 years of business experience and a wealth of knowledge and wisdom gained in the world of wellness since 2007.

> When I see that more than 50% of people do not like their work, that an increasing number of people are on antidepressants, that the mortality rate from diseases caused by our environment (what we eat, pollution, stress) is over 80%, I am telling myself that it is urgent that we create a healthier work environment! An environment where Executives and Management set the example of what is good for their health, their employees’ health, the environment; and where decisions are made to support each individual’s contribution to the greater good of the enterprise.
