> When I see that more than 50% of people do not like their work, that a lot of people are on antidepressant, that the mortality rate from diseases caused by our environment (what we eat, pollution, stress) is over 80%, I am telling myself that it is urgent that we create a healthier work environment! An environment where Executives and Management sets the example of what is good for their health, their employee’s health, the environment and where decisions are made to support each individual fulfillment for the greater good of the enterprise.
