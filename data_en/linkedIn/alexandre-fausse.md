I have called on Nancy for several years to support managers and employees in jobs I have held at Camso in the United States and at Kerry. Nancy has an approach that is both analytical and at the same time very people oriented. She knows how to deal with many subjects, whether operational issues, team cohesion issues or employee well-being. I recommend Nancy because it is easy to work with her. She has a great level of adaptability and is very attentive to her customers’ needs.
